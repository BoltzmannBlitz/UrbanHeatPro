# UrbanHeatPro
Bottom-up model for the simulation of heat demand profiles of urban areas
A. Molar-Cruz @ TUM ENS

Features
•	UrbanHeatPro is a python-based bottom-up model for the simulation of heat demand profiles of urban areas.
•	It considers both the space heating demand and hot water demand. So far, the hot water demand is calculated only for residential buildings.
•	Characteristic values for the building stock, building thermal properties, building set-temperature and annual hot water consumption are based on statistics for Germany.
•	DSM strategies for the reduction of heat demand such as building renovation, heat load reduction, night-set back operation, etc, are easily implemented.
•	The size of the study area can start from one building. Buildings can be input as a shapefile or as an excel table.
•	By default, the model operates on an hourly time steps. However, the temporal resolution is configurable.
