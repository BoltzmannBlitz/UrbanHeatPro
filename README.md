# UrbanHeatPro
Bottom-up model for the simulation of heat demand profiles of urban areas
A. Molar-Cruz @ TUM ENS

## Features

  - UrbanHeatPro is a python-based bottom-up model for the simulation of heat demand profiles of urban areas.
  - It considers both the space heating demand and hot water demand. So far, the hot water demand is calculated only for residential buildings.
  - Characteristic values for the building stock, building thermal properties, building set-temperature and annual hot water consumption are based on statistics for Germany.
  - DSM strategies for the reduction of heat demand such as building renovation, heat load reduction, night-set back operation, etc, are easily implemented.
  - The size of the study area can start from one building. Buildings can be input as a shapefile or as an excel table.
  - By default, the model operates on an hourly time steps. However, the temporal resolution is configurable.


## Requirements
Python 3.6 if multiprocessing is used (installation with Anaconda recommended)
Python 2.7 (installation with Anaconda recommended)


## Input file (csv)
Each building is described with the following information:
<ol>
  <li>Area (required)</li>
      Building ground floor area in mÂ²
  <li>Use (required)</li>
      Building use as integer:
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
          <li>0	Commercial</li>
          <li>1	Industrial</li>
          <li>2	Public</li>
          <li>3	Residential</li>
  <li>Bid (optional)</li>
      Building identification number as integer
  <li>Free_walls (required)</li>
      Number of walls in contact with ambient temperature. The building is assumed to be a rectangular box with four walls.
  <li>Construction year class (optional)</li>
      Construction year class from TABULA Typology as integer:
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
          <li>0	<1859</li>
          <li>1	1860 - 1918</li>
          <li>2	1919 - 1948</li>
          <li>3	1949 - 1957</li>
          <li>4	1958 - 1968</li>
          <li>5	1969 - 1978</li>
          <li>6	1979 - 1983</li>
          <li>7	1984 - 1994</li>
          <li>8	1995 - 2001</li>
          <li>9	2002 - 2009</li>
  <li>Building type (optional)</li>
      Building type from TABULA Typology as integer:
        0	Single-Family House (SFH)
        1	Terraced House (TH)
        2	Multi-family House (MFH)
        3	Apartment Block (AB)
</ol>
All columns are required, if no information is given, the cell value is taken as NaN.
This input file should be located in the corresponding folder input/buildings
